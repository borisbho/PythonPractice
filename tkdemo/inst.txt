# For this lab, you are going to build a useful application in Tkinter that contains one API/Web Scrape AND one Persisting Data example from the list below:

# API/Web Scrape (update once per hour):
# Weather forecast (use either openweathermap.org or web scrape weather.com)
# News headlines with functioning links to the articles (use newsapi.org and python webbrowser module)
# Money converter (use fixer.io and needs to convert to/from US dollars and at least five other types of currency)

# Persisting Data (save and load using JSON file):
# To Do list that lets you add and delete items
# Alarm Clock with sound (use either winsound or mp3play)
# Contacts list with name, email, and phone. Lets you add, edit, and delete contacts

MOVING AVERAGE:
The moving average (MA) is a simple technical analysis tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. 
The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks or any time period the trader chooses. 
There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use. 
Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.

Why Use a Moving Average
A moving average helps cut down the amount of "noise" on a price chart. 
Look at the direction of the moving average to get a basic idea of which way the price is moving. 
If it is angled up, the price is moving up (or was recently) overall; 
angled down, and the price is moving down overall; moving sideways, and the price is likely in a range.

A moving average can also act as support or resistance. 
In an uptrend, a 50-day, 100-day or 200-day moving average may act as a support level, as shown in the figure below. 
This is because the average acts like a floor (support), so the price bounces up off of it. In a downtrend, a moving average may act as resistance; 
like a ceiling, the price hits the level and then starts to drop again.



OPEN-HIGH-LOW-CLOSE:
Open-High-Low-Close Charts show the high and low price a stock attained for a particular period of time as 
well as the opening and closing prices of the stock for the same period. ... 
The opening and closing prices can be shown in two ways: by markers on the line, 
or by open-close bars superimposed on the high-low lines.


S&P 500:
Top 500 comps by market cap(value)
The # of outstand shares * price = value

PERCENTAGE:
To compute percentage change in stock price if you don't have a digital percent gain calculator app handy, 
simply subtract the old price from the new price and divide the difference by the old price. 
Then, multiply by 100 to get the percent change. If the sign is negative, that means that the price decreased. 
If it's positive, the price increased over time.

If you call the old price p1 and the new price p2, you can write the formula as 100 * (p2 - p1) / p1. 
This formula works for all kinds of values that change over time, not just for stock prices.
